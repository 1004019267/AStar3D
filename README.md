# AStar3D
AStar3D is the algorithm on Unity5.6.2

it  like navmesh,the navmesh doesn't use the binary reactor to optimization.

use navmesh you will bake the road in the sence view,this is a state method.

this algorithm was dynamic to add the path,but don't use it too frequently,like in update to use it

if you want to dynamic find path ,Dijkstra was a better algorithm
